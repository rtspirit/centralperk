               <div class="blogcontent">
                We are excited to introduce our Coffee Shop & Cafe, "Central Perk". If you crave great coffee, you’ll love
                 knowing that we provide a real alternative to chains with handcrafted coffee and espresso drinks,
                  a full tea bar, and real food options. <br>

                “We grind for you”… our local baristas know that great espresso takes more than pushing a button. We work hard to deliver 
                taste while also providing knowledgeable service, perfect if you just want to try something new.<br>
                
                Our Cafe delivers way beyond the traditional coffee shop favorites (although we think our homemade pastries are pretty good). We have traditional breakfast choices, including eggs, omelettes,
                 pancakes, and plenty of healthy options (including gluten free, vegetarian, and vegan).  Be sure to check out our weekend 
                 specials, when we go all out to provide you with new options that are delicious and different.   Finally,  we also serve a 
                 wide variety of salads,  sandwiches and flatbreads for lunch-lovers.<br>
                
                And as a final quick intro to “us”- the owners: we are New York residents (no franchise or corporate owners in sight).
                 The Central Perk at 90 Bedford, New York can actually deliver what we promise- a great restaurant and coffee shop 
                 experience.
