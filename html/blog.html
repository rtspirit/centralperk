                The menu looks fantastic. Very creative, each dish has a name named after one of the protagonists. 
                Like ‘Phoebe’s Vegetarian Pizza’ or ‘Ross’ Banana Split, the one that Marcel likes’. We took a cappuccino,
                 the (pink!) iced coffee ‘Monica Geller, the one with Monica’s jam’ and ‘Mrs. Braverman’s Cheesecake’. 
                 The costs are $40, around €26. A considerable amount, but of course you also pay for the experience.

             I had the time of my life. You can find here the couch where everyone poses for the picture. 
             You really get the impression that you’ve ended up in the series, especially when you hear the episode
              in the background. Of course, you can also buy some souvenirs. Don’t forget your credit card, you will need it.
               And last but not least, the kitchen of the apartment of Monica and Rachel has been recreated with thé slot machine.

           Every Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday you can follow a barista workshop at half-past eleven. This costs $480 per person, €320. Every month there are several events in the restaurant,
            including ‘Chandler Comedy Night’, ‘Phoebe Open Mic’ and ‘Ross Trivia Nights’. If you are looking for the best coffee in 
            Singapore, this is not the place to be. If you are a fan of the Friends series and have always wanted to have a cup of 
            coffee in Central Perk, then you should visit the Central Perk Café in New York.
